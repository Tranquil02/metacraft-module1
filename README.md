MyContract
MyContract is a simple Solidity smart contract that allows you to manage a single uint value. This contract includes functions to set, increment, and reset the value with various checks and validations.

Features
Set a Value: Ensures the value is greater than zero before setting it.
Increment the Value: Increments the current value by one with an assert check.
Reset the Value: Resets the value to zero with a revert condition if the value is not already zero.
